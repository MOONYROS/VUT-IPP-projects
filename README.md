# VUT-IPP-projects (2022/2023)

Goal of these 2 projects was to make an interpret (working name **IPPCode23**) for IFJCode22 (essentialy a subset of *PHP 8*) language.
To know more about the IFJCode22 language, please see my repository with that project [here](https://github.com/MOONYROS/VUT-IFJ-project).
So, what is was basically aimed to do was to interpret *assembler-like* instructions like for any interpreted language.

First task was to parse instructions from *stdin*, do a lexical and a slight syntax analysis and then write the output into *XML file* using `PHP 8`.
For further information, please see the project documentation in `proj1/readme1.pdf`. Note that the documentation is in Czech language only.

Second task was aimed to get that *XML file* from the first one, process the information and write the results of the program onto the *stdout* while using `Python 3`.
To know more about the functionality of this projects, please see the documentation in `proj2/readme2.pdf`.
